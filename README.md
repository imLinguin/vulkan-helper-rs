# vulkan-helper-rs

A simple CLI app used to interface with basic Vulkan APIs. I guess it's useful for apps that are unable to call the API directly for some reasons.

## Usage

Commands:
  instance-version
  physical-versions
  help               Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
